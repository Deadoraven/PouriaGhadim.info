        <li>I started to learn programming when I was 12 by learning html and creating a lot of empty web pages that was
            never deployed.

        <li>Although it's always fun to play with CSS and design the front end, I rather to work on the backend.</li>
        <li>First programming language that I worked with was BASIC in highschool. Later on I learned MatLab and
            Fortran. I was Studying Aerospace at the time.
        </li>
        <li>I didn't finish my degree and immigrated to United states. Started college to get my degree in
            Computer Science.
        </li>
        <li>After I transferred to University of Washington, I started to work as a Researcher on a HoloLens Project.
